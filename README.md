# -- VALKYRIETRY --
### Fail, Retry, Succeed With Valkryrietry
</div>

## Overview
Valkyrietry is a robust and intuitive GoLang library designed to bring resilience to your applications with its powerful retry mechanisms. Inspired by the legendary Valkyries, symbols of strength and determination, Valkyrietry embodies these attributes to ensure your operations don't just fail, but have the strength to retry and ultimately succeed.

## Key Features
- **Simplicity**: Valkyrietry is built with a focus on simple API, making it straightforward to integrate into your existing GoLang projects.
- **Ease of Use**: With minimal configuration and sensible defaults, you can start implementing advanced retry logic in no time.
- **Resilience**: Crafted to withstand and recover from failures, Valkyrietry ensures your applications remain robust under various failure scenarios.
- **Flexible Retry Mechanism**: Customizable retry strategies, including configurable delay intervals, max retry attempts, backoff algorithms, and jitter for more natural retry patterns.

## Getting Started
To get started with Valkyrietry, simply install the library in your GoLang project and start wrapping your critical operations with Valkyrietry's retry functionality.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"github.com/ruang-guru/valkyrietry"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	options := []valkyrietry.Option{
		valkyrietry.WithMaxRetryAttempts(1),
		valkyrietry.WithRetryDelay(2 * time.Second),
		valkyrietry.WithRetryBackoffMultiplier(2),
		valkyrietry.WithJitter(0.2),
	}

	retryFunc := func() error {
		resp, err := http.Get("http://testingexample.com")
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Request failed, will retry:", err)
			return err
		}
		defer resp.Body.Close()

		if resp.StatusCode >= 500 {
			// Simulate server-side error
			return errors.New("server error, retrying")
		}
		fmt.Println("Request succeeded")
		return nil
	}

	// Use Valkyrietry to handle the retry logic
	if err := valkyrietry.Do(ctx, retryFunc, options...); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Operation failed after retries:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Operation successful")
}
```
